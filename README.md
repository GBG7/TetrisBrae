This program utilizes the Pygame library to create a functional Tetris game. The game includes a grid for the Tetrominoes to fall and stack on,
a next piece preview, and a system for clearing full rows.
The player can move and rotate the falling Tetromino using the arrow keys, and the game ends if a Tetromino is unable to fit onto the grid.

This program utilizes tkinter library to create windows that allow you to
login, register, read instructions on how to play the game, and play the game if
you login succesfully.
You can register an account, and proceed to login. The code is written so that if you
attempt to register another account, the old registration credientials are over written
with the newer ones.
Kendrick lamar is played in the background.
